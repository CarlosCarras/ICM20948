  Sends a command/data sequence that can include restarts, writes and reads. Every transmission begins with a START,
  and ends with a STOP so you do not have to specify that.
  sequence is the I2C operation sequence that should be performed. It can include any number of writes, restarts and
  reads. Note that the sequence is composed of uint16_t, not uint8_t. This is because we have to support out-of-band
  signalling of I2C_RESTART and I2C_READ operations, while still passing through 8-bit data.
  sequence_length is the number of sequence elements (not bytes). Sequences of arbitrary length are supported, but
  there is an upper limit on the number of segments (restarts): no more than 42. The minimum sequence length is
  (rather obviously) 2.
  received_data should point to a buffer that can hold as many bytes as there are I2C_READ operations in the
  sequence. If there are no reads, 0 can be passed, as this parameter will not be used.
